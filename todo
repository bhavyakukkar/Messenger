Config:
- figure out why todo is not being gitignored


Server:
- (only testing remaining) after any message is sent, sender's and recipient's contacts-list.json updates to bring recipient and sender contacts, respectively, to the front of the list

- fetch_notification.php that returns whether there is an unread message between specified user and contact
- delete_notification.php that removes the presence of unread message


Client:
- use text-overflow: elipsis on div#contact-name so that it does not compress whilst no contact is selected on the welcome screen (https://stackoverflow.com/a/486571/15597840)
- Login/Register/New Contact headings in respective screens
- settings toolbar with option to sign out

- every user can enable or disable incoming requests (adds error-case in new-contact where requested user has disabled requests)
- option to change password
- use smaller images (send message & new contact icons) and use them locally
